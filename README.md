# Inches to Meters Converter App

This is a simple Inches to Meters converter app made in Java for Android devices. As a student of mobile development for Android, I created this app as part of my learning process.

The app has a simple and intuitive user interface, with a light mode and a dark mode version. The user can input a value in inches and the app will convert it to meters instantly. The conversion is done using a simple formula and the result is displayed in real-time.

This repository contains the source code of the app, which can be used as a reference for other students or developers who want to learn how to create a simple Android app using Java.

Feel free to download and use this app or to contribute to the repository by submitting issues or pull requests.
